Notes on the Parvis classes

The first check-in is the complete source code and 
*.gif files as downloaded from
http://home.subnet.at/flo/mv/parvis/
on 28 July 00, all classes and images authored by Flo Ledermann (flo@subnet.at).
Files with the extension .nbattrs and .form were not checked in. 

Subsequent modifications were done as noted in the CVS.

To quote Flo from http://home.subnet.at/flo/mv/parvis/developer.html

"If you like parvis and you want to improve it, just go ahead!
Parvis is open source, and as long as you leave the GPL intact and
release all your code under the GPL, you are authorized to do
whatever you want with the code."

The GPL should be present in the same directory as this note.
